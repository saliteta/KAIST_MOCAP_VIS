## Visualize marker and skeleton in 3D space

### Visualize sequence:
- skeleton_seqeunce_show, given skeleton position as np.ndarray t*joints_number*3, as well as the edge_relationship
- marker_squence_show, given marker positon as a np.array. dimension: time_length*makrer_number*3


### visualize one_frame:
- skeleton_show, given skeleton postion as np.ndarray and edge_relationship. dimension: joints_number*3 and edges
- marker_show, given marker positon as a np.array. dimension: makrer_number*3
